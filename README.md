## Insipration
As we are all well aware, there are currently strict restrictions in place and UoE students are spread all across the globe. This has had a huge impact on the ability of students to meet other like minded and ambitious people and it has also made it harder for students to get involved in the things that they enjoy. As first year students, this has hit us particularly hard as we have struggled to make connections with our fellow students and to get to grips with university life and finding out about the opportunities that are available to us. Many of us are interested in participating in the wide range of projects that are on offer to university students so that we can put our (coding) skills to the test, experience new things and meet other students however this has posed to be a great challenge during the pandemic. 

## What does it do?
Our solution to this problem is to provide an app for university students to sign up for projects and opportunities that interest them with ease. Our goal is to create an interface where both developers (better word if not just coding/software based projects) and students can be paired up and collaborate. This will help developers to find the talent that they require and this will help motivate students to get involved and expand their horizons.

## How does it work?
Any person can sign up as a project organiser or a project participant.

During the signup process, participants are asked to list the various project fields and topics that they would be interested in working on. Participants will then be given a list of suitable projects using a recommender system. The participant and the project organiser(s) can then be put in contact through a chat system on the website. This is done to ensure that the chat between the donor and donee is done in a safe and secure manner. They will be able to discuss the project details, schedule an interview and decide whether they want to work together.

Throughout the entire process, the details of both the participant and project organiser(s) will be kept anonymous.
Participants will be kept updated regularly on new projects that appear on the app that would be of interest to them. 

## How have we built it?
Android studio, java, firebase etc 

## Challenges we encountered
We encountered challenges getting used to using Android studio and all the components involved.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We successfully created an app using Android studio.
We were able to code a basic recommender system.

## What have we learned?
We have learned a lot about app making and recommender systems and we have improved our Java coding abilities.

## What's next?
Ideally, the profile of the project organiser(s) should be checked to ensure that the project is legitimate and that it is safe.

A reward based system could be implemented which would motivate students to participate in more projects.

We could also have the CVs of users attached to their profile  if desired which would be on display for project organisers which would help students potentially receive  internships and job offers.

There could also be links to other things that students could get involved in e.g. society events, competitions, hackathons.
